Console Tic tac toe
===================
This is a command line version of the unbeatable ruby tic tac toe before I packaged the core game logic up into a gem.

Usage:
------
- To run the app:
  + Clone the repo.
  + cd to the directory.
  + Make sure you are using ruby 1.9.3-p484 ( There is a .ruby-version file.  There are syntax errors with 2.0)
  + Type $ bin/ttt
  + Play the game.
- To run the specs:
 + cd to the directory.
 + Type $ rspec
