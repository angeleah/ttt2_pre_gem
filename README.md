Console Tic tac toe
===================
This is a command line version of the ruby tic tac toe before I packaged the core game logic up into a gem.  You can play human vs. human, computer vs computer, or human vs computer.  It is unbeatable when playing the computer. Play two computers against eachother to see them always draw!  This uses the minimax algorithm to make move decisions.

Usage:
------
- To run the app:
  + Clone the repo.
  + cd to the directory.
  + Make sure you are using ruby 1.9.3-p484 ( There is a .ruby-version file.  There are syntax errors with 2.0)
  + Type $ bin/ttt
  + Play the game.
- To run the specs:
 + cd to the directory.
 + Type $ rspec
